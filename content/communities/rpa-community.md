## Purpose

The RPA CoP helps individual agencies overcome the technical, management, and operational challenges that arise in designing and deploying an effective RPA program. This includes important initiatives like designing common federal standards for credentialing, privacy, and security, and designing common management metrics to gauge government-wide impact of RPA.

## What We Do

The CoP helps agencies convert RPA enthusiasm into action. Specifically, the CoP assists agencies in developing programs that are cost-effective, auditable, avoid common pitfalls, and most importantly, deploy impactful automations. To this end, the CoP hosts frequent knowledge-sharing events and publishes valuable guidance on best practices.

## Resources

The RPA community has built several resources, including an RPA Program [Playbook]({{< ref "rpa-playbook.md" >}}), an [Internal Controls Guide](https://digital.gov/pdf/rpa-playbook-ic-addendum-v1.0.pdf), and the [Federal Use Case Inventory]({{< ref "rpa-use-case-inventory.md" >}}). Check out our [RPA Guide]({{< ref "guides/rpa" >}}) to learn more!
